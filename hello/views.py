    #   2. You have uncommented the `psycopg` dependency in `requirements.txt`, and the `release`
    #      process entry in `Procfile`, git committed your changes and re-deployed the app.
    #
    # When running the app locally:
    #   1. You have run `./manage.py migrate` to create the `hello_greeting` database table.
